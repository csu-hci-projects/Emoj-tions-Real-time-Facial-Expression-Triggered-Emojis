# Emoj-tions-Real-time-Facial-Expression-Triggered-Emojis

This prototype is a macOS application which runs in the menu bar. To run...

1. Clone this repo onto your MacOS machine. Do this by opening Xcode -> Source Control -> Clone... -> submit this repos GitHub URL.
3. Run the .project file using Xcode.

When ran, notice that...
* The user facing menu-bar application appears, allowing them to capture their facial expression.
* A proctor facing text input appears, allowing the proctor to feed what facial expression exists on the users face into a series of switch statements, which assigns it to an emoji.

What still needs to be complete is...
1. The facial expression turned emoji should be applied to the users clipboard for easy pasting. 
2. The emoji most recently assigned to their emotion should replace the robot emoji in the menu bar application (tentative, this is low priority for the prototype)

Overall, the current product will allow A/B testing using Wizard of Oz.
