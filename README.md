# Emoj-tions-Real-time-Facial-Expression-Triggered-Emojis

This prototype is a macOS application which runs in the menu bar. To run...

1. Clone this repo onto your MacOS machine. Do this by opening Xcode -> Source Control -> Clone... -> submit this repos GitHub URL.
3. Run the .project file using Xcode.

When ran, notice that...
* The user facing menu-bar application appears, allowing them to capture their facial expression.
* A proctor facing text input appears, allowing the proctor to feed what facial expression exists on the users face into a series of switch statements, which assigns it to an emoji.

Overall, the current prototype allows usability & A/B testing via Wizard of Oz.
